    "# Object-Oriented Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of writing programs that represent real-world problem spaces (in terms of objects, functions, classes, attributes, methods, and inheritance). As Allen Downey explains in [__Think Python__](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython018.html), in object-oriented programming, we shift away from framing the *function* as the active agent and toward seeing the *object* as the active agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, we are going to create a class that represents the rational numbers. This tutorial was originally adapted by [Rebecca Bilbro](https://github.com/rebeccabilbro/Tutorials/tree/master/OOP) from content in Anand Chitipothu's [__Python Practice Book__](http://anandology.com/python-practice-book/index.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Classes, methods, modules, and packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our workshop we will modify the code in this Jupyter notebook by filling in the missing functionality.  We have a `Rationalnumber` class which can be used to make objects of type... `RationalNumber`.  These are basically fractions and we can leverage the built-ins in Python to take two objects of this type and add, multiply, subtract, or divide using traditional math operations such as `+`, `*`, `-`, and `/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you add code you can \"execute\" the notebook cell to check your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may help to review [built-ins in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) and the [Python data model](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html)."
